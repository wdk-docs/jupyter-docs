Whether you are a new, returning, or current contributor to Project Jupyter’s subprojects or IPython, we welcome you.

Project Jupyter has seen steady growth over the past several years, and it is wonderful to see the many ways people are using these projects. As a result of this rapid expansion, our project maintainers are balancing many requirements, needs, and resources. We ask contributors to take some time to become familiar with our contribution guides and spend some time learning about our project communication and workflow.

The Contributor Guides and individual project documentation offer guidance. If you have a question, please ask us. Community Resources provides information on our commonly used communication methods.

We are very pleased to have you as a contributor, and we hope you will find valuable your impact on the projects. Thank you for sharing your interests, ideas, and skills with us.
