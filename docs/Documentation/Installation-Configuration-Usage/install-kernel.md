## 内容

- Are any languages pre-installed?
- How do I install Python 2 and Python 3?
- How do I install other languages like R or Julia?

This information gives a high-level view of using Jupyter Notebook with different programming languages (kernels).

## 是否已预先安装任何语言？

Yes, installing the Jupyter Notebook will also install the IPython kernel. This allows working on notebooks using the Python programming language.

## 如何安装 Python 2 和 Python 3？

To install an additional version of Python, i.e. to have both Python 2 and 3 available, see the IPython docs on installing kernels.

## 如何安装 R 或 Julia 等其他语言？

To run notebooks in languages other than Python, such as R or Julia, you will need to install additional kernels. For more information, see the full list of available kernels.
