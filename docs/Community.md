Stay Connected
Project Jupyter offers a number of communication channels available to individuals interested in using and contributing to the project.

Jupyter is a community of data enthusiasts who believe in the power of open tools and standards for education, research, and data analytics. We welcome contributions and contributors of all kinds - whether they come as contributions to code, participation in the community, opening issues and pointing out bugs, or simply sharing your work with your colleagues and friends.

Join the Jupyter community
If you’re interested in joining the Jupyter community (yay!) we recommend checking out the Jupyter Contributing guide. This contains information about the different projects in the Jupyter ecosystem, the tools and skills that are useful for each project, and other ways that you can become a part of the Jupyter community.

JupyterDays, JupyterCon, and other events
Many members of the Jupyter community host events to connect others that use Jupyter and other tools in the open data analytics stack. For example, JupyterCon is an annual conference that brings together many different groups represented in the Jupyter Community. Jupyter Days are smaller, locally-organized events for learning and connecting with one another. For example, here’s a post announcing Jupyter Days in Atlanta. If you’d like to organize a Jupyter Days event in your community, please reach out!

Participate online
Jupyter also has a number of online communication channels to help keep in touch.

As you interact with others in the Jupyter ecosystem, remember that we have a strong commitment to being an open, inclusive, and positive community. Please read the Jupyter Code of Conduct for guidance on how to interact with others in a way that makes the community thrive.

Below is a short list of gitter channels, email listservs, and github repositories where you can get involved. We always welcome participation in the Jupyter community.
